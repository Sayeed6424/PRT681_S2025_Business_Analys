Although I was unable to attend the group meeting, I have reviewed the topics that were discussed and continued to stay aligned with the group’s progress:

I followed up on the group's discussion of Waterfall, B-model, and SCRUM methodologies, and reviewed relevant materials to stay updated.

I began exploring Angular applications, with a focus on working with forms and tables, as discussed by the group.

I reviewed Microsoft Web API examples using Entity Framework to better understand backend integration.

I also looked into Angular Web API integration examples to prepare for future development tasks.
